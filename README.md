Generative AI in Data Science explores how to leverage generative models for data preparation by creating synthetic data, filling in missing values, and augmenting datasets to enhance the performance of machine learning models.

prompt.py - How to use generative AI for data preparation.

stock.py - The objective is to apply McTaggart's A-series and B-series philosophical frameworks to stock market analysis by categorizing market events into dynamic (A-series) sequences of past, present, and future, and fixed (B-series) relationships of before and after significant events, to gain novel insights into market behavior through machine learning models and event impact analysis.

synthetic_data_augmentation.py - The goal is to generate and enhance synthetic data to augment the training process of machine learning models for improved prediction accuracy.
