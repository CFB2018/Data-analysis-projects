Objective: Apply McTaggart's A-series and B-series philosophical frameworks to stock market analysis, drawing parallels between temporal relationships and market dynamics. 
Inspired by McTaggart's "The Unreality of Time," this approach explores how market events can be categorized as sequences of "future, present, and past" (A-series) or 
as relationships of "earlier and later" (B-series). By integrating phenomenological and metaphysical insights, the project seeks to uncover whether stock market events exhibit properties of temporal change (A-series) 
or enduring relationships (B-series), and whether this duality can provide a novel perspective on market behavior.
